# LM393 Photoresistor

#### This module is highly sensitive to ambient light. When the ambient light reaches the set threshold, the microcontroller or retransmission modules are activated. The output is high when the ambient light exceeds the set threshold. The DO output can be directly connected to a microcontroller to detect the light environment and create a light control switch. It has a sensitivity range from 0% to 100%.
