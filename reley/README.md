# Reley

#### It's a type of switch that can be used to control a high-power circuit with a low-power signal, often used for switching electrical appliances and devices. Relays come in various configurations, such as single-pole single-throw (SPST), single-pole double-throw (SPDT), double-pole single-throw (DPST), and double-pole double-throw (DPDT), depending on the number of circuits they can control and the number of positions the switch can adopt.
