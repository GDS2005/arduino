# SG90

#### The SG90 is a type of micro servo motor. It is a device that can precisely control angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. The SG90 is controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals. The position of the servo is determined by the width of the pulse, with typical positions ranging from 0° to 180°.
